# DES
DES (Data Exchange Server)

This repository contains documentation, Howto's, best practices, plugins, scripts and other useful material concerning the use and implementations with the DES application.

The DES software developed and implemented by A.C and authors at the Institute for Earth Observation at EURAC Research (former Institute for Applied Remote Sensing),is a standalone application to enable the concurrent execution of tasks and data transfers by means of a set of XML processor configuration files.  It has been primarily developed to fit the requirements of the EURAC receiving station processing chain and SDI Infrastructure at EURAC Research where big amounts of data need to be processed, transferred from system to system or delivered to some end users. The DES implements a concurrent, multi-threaded mechanism to transfer different kind of data in PUSH and GET mode using standard protocols like HTTP, SFTP, FTP, SSH. 
The DES may be seen as a general, multi-tasking application that can execute concurrently configurable tasks or jobs implemented in form of dedicated plug-ins or scripts.
